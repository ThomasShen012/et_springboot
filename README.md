expense tracker by spring boot


## Setup
I replaced my 'application.properties' with 'application.properties.example' to cover my username and password

Make sure to update these in your own application.prperties
- `spring.datasource.username`: Your PostgreSQL username
- `spring.datasource.password`: Your PostgreSQL password
